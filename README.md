TODO
 - ⛔ Add a system which asks if the user wants to exit the application (most likely with a "save" button to save the text that the user inputted
 - ⛔ Figure out a system for formatting the text for the description so that it does not do a weird line break for example in a straight line, the text shows up fine but if I press enter something along the lines of the below happens:

 - :white_check_mark: Test with different colors for the background of the application to see which ones/a combo of ones work best
 - ⛔ Figure out how to change the default dark and light theme colors (dark theme = 36393f & light theme = dcddde)
 - ⛔ Figure out how styling multiple TextBlocks in /Styles/TextBlock.xaml works
 - Remove all of th Grid.Row lines beause the mess up the styling and formatting of the application

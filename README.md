##### What is txt?<br>
txt is an open source text editor that I built because I started findng all of these different text editors a bit too much and I wanted to go for a minimal design which still has the functionality of a regular text editor (like Windows Notepad)
<br>
<br>
##### What makes txt differ from other text editors?
txt is a super light-weight text editor which although has a lot less fucntions compared to a regular text editor (like Windows Notepad), it has other features such as a file viewer (which is still under development)
<br>

❗The file read option reads text from the file but does not put it in the TextBox
<br>
❗Currently there is no .exe file for this application
